# Book_recomendation
In this project, you will build a book recommendation system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to suggest books that are similar to a given book. The recommendation engine will be based on a dataset called Book-Crossings, which contains over 1.1 million ratings (on a scale of 1-10) of approximately 270,000 books from 90,000 users.
Key Steps:

    Data Preprocessing:
        The first step involves importing and cleaning the Book-Crossings dataset.
        After loading the dataset, you'll remove any users who have rated fewer than 200 books and any books with fewer than 100 ratings to ensure statistical significance in the recommendations.

    Using K-Nearest Neighbors:
        You'll use the NearestNeighbors class from sklearn.neighbors to implement the KNN algorithm. This will help measure the "closeness" of books based on their ratings, allowing the system to find similar books to the one requested by a user.

    Recommendation Function:
        The core of the project involves creating the function get_recommends. This function takes a book title as input and returns a list of 5 books that are most similar to the input book, along with their distance from the original book (indicating how similar they are).

    Example output of get_recommends for the book "The Queen of the Damned (Vampire Chronicles)":

    [
      'The Queen of the Damned (Vampire Chronicles)',
      [
        ['Catch 22', 0.793983519077301], 
        ['The Witching Hour (Lives of the Mayfair Witches)', 0.7448656558990479], 
        ['Interview with the Vampire', 0.7345068454742432],
        ['The Tale of the Body Thief (Vampire Chronicles (Paperback))', 0.5376338362693787],
        ['The Vampire Lestat (Vampire Chronicles, Book II)', 0.5178412199020386]
      ]
    ]

        The output consists of the original book's title followed by a list of recommended books with their respective distances (indicating how similar they are).

    Data Filtering:
        Given that most books in the dataset are not rated frequently, you will filter out books with fewer than 100 ratings and users with fewer than 200 ratings to ensure the data used for training is statistically significant.

    Testing the Model:
        The final cell will test the function get_recommends with various books and ensure that the system can accurately return similar book recommendations.

Optional:

    You can visualize the dataset graphically to observe patterns in the book ratings, though this step is optional.

Course Context:

This project is part of a machine learning course designed to teach students about K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and its application in building recommendation systems. It provides hands-on experience with data preprocessing, model creation, and working with real-world datasets in the context of collaborative filtering for recommendations.
Expected Outcome:

By the end of this project, you will have built a recommendation engine that can suggest books based on similarity to a given book using KNN, allowing users to discover books they might enjoy based on their preferences.
